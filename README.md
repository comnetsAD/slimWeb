## SlimWebPlugin

This directory containes all the plugin files for building SlimWeb Plugin. Alternatively, you can directly install the plugin from this public url: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jslite/

We have tested the plugin on Firefox for Android (68.1.1). 

## SlimWebModel

This directory contains the Machine Learning Model that should be deployed in the Slim Web Service so that the SlimWeb Plugin can get critical/non-critical labels from it. 
All the files from models_and_features.zip must be extracted and placed in the same directory for proper working of SlimWeb.py
